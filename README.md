# Renameable Ships
[Nexusmods](https://www.nexusmods.com/ixion/mods/14)  
<br>
You can now rename your ships with a new button in the docking bay ui.
> [!WARNING]
If you rename a ship, save and load that save, without the mod installed, it will have a different random name each time you load.  
It will go back to whatever you named it, if you load the save with the mod installed again.  
There is no way to reverse this, so you have to build a new ship if you want to go back.
